1.	Progress Made: We have assigned tasks for each person in our group. Person1 is going to research and identify APIs and data sources for financial articles and social media platforms (e.g., Kaggle, Twitter API). Person2 is going to develop and implement a topic modeling pipeline (e.g., using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or BERT). Person3 is going to integrate Microsoftâ€™s AutoGen toolkit or an equivalent framework to create the intelligent task agent. Person4 is going to design and develop a user-friendly web interface. So far, we have completed the first step to collect data for topic modeling. We have created an agent program for topic modeling and create plot for the ticker. We also coded draft version of front end UI and the backend app.py to execute the backend codes.

2.	Remaining Tasks: We will fine tune the agent and data collection codes after group review and then integrate it with front-end UI code to complete the project work.

3.	Any Challenges/Issues:
